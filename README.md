# Deep-Crypto-Predict
Using novel RNN-LSTM architecture for cryptocurrency market analysis.
This code brings together crypto and deep learning in a despirate attemt to reddit poularity.
Predicts the actual Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in market.
You can refer this code for predicting the Crypo-currency prices in market to the actual value.

# Quick Run
The easiest way to run the code is to download the .ipynb file and upload it to Colab. Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. The hosted runtime already includes the following dependencies:

Numpy
Keras
Tensorflow
Matplotlib
which are all we need to run this project.

Alternative you can open the .ipynb file using Jupyter notebook. If you do this you will also have to set up a local kernel that includes Tensorflow.
