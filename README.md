# Deep-Crypto-Predict
Using novel RNN-LSTM architecture for cryptocurrency market analysis. This code brings together crypto and deep learning in a desperate attempt to Reddit popularity. Predicts the actual Bitcoin and Ethereum prices in the market. You can refer to this code for predicting the Crypto-currency prices in the market to the actual value.

# Quick Run
The easiest way to run the code is to download the .ipynb file and upload it to Colab. Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. The hosted runtime already includes the following dependencies:

Numpy
Keras
Tensorflow
Matplotlib
which are all we need to run this project.

Alternative you can open the .ipynb file using Jupyter notebook. If you do this you will also have to set up a local kernel that includes Tensorflow.
